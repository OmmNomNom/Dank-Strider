	<h2> Biography<h2/>
	<p style=font-size:16;> The Groose wakes up every morning and puts his pants on TWO legs at a time. None of that wuss one leg at a time thing for Groose. Then the Groose does a bazillion squats to  keep his Groose caboose in shape followed by an infinate amount of push ups...you know just because. Groose also has to have somebody type this for him because the Groose has painfully large fingures and faces diversity everyday because of this. And by faces divesrsity he means he RKOs it in to a mountain forming a volcano.</p>
